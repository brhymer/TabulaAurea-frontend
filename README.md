# Project 4

## MVP

This as yet unnamed app allows the user to track monthly spending as compared to income.  The user can also list all assets and liabilities.  Finally, the user can make a todo and wish list.  If time permits, I will add an API that adds in the current prices of certain investment options such as gold.

The project is a MERN stack using native CSS.  It will make use of React Router to render all four pages/components on a single page screen.

## Wireframes
